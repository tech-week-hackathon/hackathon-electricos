The team created Blockfrost and CardanoScan API keys for this project and they are hardcoded in the code to facilitate usage. Also, to test some use cases, you should have a mainnet Cardano wallet in your browser.

The data referring to the suggested vote for each delegator was generated by us. The proposal transaction hashes, the drep addresses, the delegators of each drep and the votes of each drep are obtained from Cardano via APIs.
